# The Game of Hex: Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search

> Note: the full version of this code was lost on my laptop, so the program is currently in a non-working state

## Overview
This program replicates the structure of AlphaGo when playing Hex, a board game invented by John Nash and Piet Hein. The program is written in Python and uses the TensorFlow library.

## Setup

1. Install Python 3.6 or later.
2. Install TensorFlow. This can be done by running the following command:
```console
pip install tensorflow
```
3. Download the source code for the program.
```console
git clone https://github.com/wkaisertexas/SF-Project-HEX
```
## Usage

Run the program by executing the following command:
```console
python main.py
```
## Features
This program contains an interactive mode which allows the user to play against the AI as well as train their own.

## Awards

I am proud to share that this program won the Physical Sciences Grand Award at the [Name of the Science Fair/Competition] in 9th grade. The project was recognized for its innovative approach to replicating the structure of AlphaGo when playing Hex using TensorFlow and Python. The program was developed by William Kaiser.
