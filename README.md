# SF-Project-HEX
This is my Science Fair project.  This will use Ai in order to play the game of Hex, created by Piet Hein in the 1940s.   

This was written for my 9th grade science fair during which I won the Grand-Award at districts, but then was unable to make it to the second round of my category in Houston.
